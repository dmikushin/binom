# Fast divisionless computation of binomial coefficients

This is a [binom code](https://github.com/lemire/Code-used-on-Daniel-Lemire-s-blog/tree/master/2020/02/26) by Daniel Lemire described in his [blog post](https://lemire.me/blog/2020/02/26/fast-divisionless-computation-of-binomial-coefficients/). The code is taken to a new repo instead of fork, as suggested by the author.
